### Test Executions / Results

**ðŸ‘‰The status of the test executions and the results can be found here: [TestReport.md](./TestReport.md)**


### NanoMig-vAmigaTS-Results

This repository contains the results of test executions from the [vAmiga Test Suite](https://github.com/dirkwhoffmann/vAmigaTS), generated by the [NanoMig](https://github.com/harbaum/NanoMig) Verilator simulation. 
The images generated by the test executions can be used to validate the accuracy of the NanoMig simulation by comparing its output against reference images from the vAmiga Test Suite, which has been validated against real Amiga hardware.

### Contents

This repository primarily consists of screenshots from the NanoMig simulation, which correspond to specific tests from the vAmiga Test Suite.
Each screenshot can be compared with the reference image found in the vAmiga Test Suite repository by searching for the filename of the image without the ".png" extension. For example, to find the reference image for `bbusy0.png`, you can use this search query: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adirkwhoffmann%2FvAmigaTS+bbusy0 .

### Scope of these test

The combination of the NanoMig environment and the vAmiga Test Suite might allow for easy and systematic identification of existing issues.
Further investigation is needed of issues uncovered by these tests stem from porting of Minimig to the Tang Nano 20K, 
or are related to the Minimig core itself (which is also used in MiSTer FPGA and the Amiga core for Analogue Pocket).
